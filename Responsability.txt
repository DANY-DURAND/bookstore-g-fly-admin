Project Overview:
This Statement of Work (SOW) will outline the scope of work for my part as a backend developer to support the development of a G-Fly store project. The project's primary goal is to create a top-notch book sales and inventory store system. 

Project Activities:
The backend developer will be responsible for the following activities:
1. System Architecture and Design:
-Collaborate with the project team to define the system architecture and database design.
-Identify and select appropriate technologies and frameworks for the backend development.
2. Database Setup and Management:
- Create and configure the project's database, ensuring data security and integrity.
- Implement data models, tables, and establish efficient database interactions.
3. API Development:
- Develop robust and efficient APIs to facilitate data communication between the frontend and backend.
- Implement necessary authentication and authorization mechanisms for API endpoints.
4. Server Logic and Business Logic:
- Create server-side logic to process and handle data requests and business operations.
- Implement business rules and application logic to ensure the system functions as intended.
5. Data Integration:
- Integrate third-party APIs or services as required for data synchronization or external interactions.
6. Performance Optimization:
- Continuously monitor and optimize the backend system for performance, scalability, and resource utilization.
7. Testing and Debugging:
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve bugs, errors, and performance issues.
- Collaborate with the quality assurance team to ensure a stable and reliable system.
8. Documentation:
- Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for the backend codebase and APIs.
- Create user guides or developer documentation as needed.
9. Security Measures:
- Implement security best practices to protect the system against vulnerabilities, including data encryption and access control.
10. Deployment and Maintenance:
- Support the deployment of backend components to production servers or cloud environments.
- Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the backend infrastructure.

Timeline:
The backend development is expected to commence on October 5, 2023 and be completed by November 10, 2023. The specific project timeline and milestones will be detailed in the project schedule.

Deliverables:
The backend developer is expected to deliver the following:
- Fully functional backend system with documented APIs.
- Database structure and design.
- Documentation for backend code and APIs.
- Performance-optimized backend components.
- Security measures implementation.

Change Requests:
Any change requests or modifications to the project scope will be subject to approval through a formal change request process.

Acceptance Criteria:
The project will be considered complete when the backend system passes quality assurance testing, meets the agreed-upon performance standards, and aligns with the project's objectives.
